This is my current (as of 11/5/2023) personal dotfiles repository.  The method I'm currently using requres the use of git and GNU stow.  Instructions for installing:
```
git clone https://github.com/jtknowles007/Dotfiles.git ~/Dotfiles
cd ~/Dotfiles
stow i3 i3status bash (etc.)
```

Here's a good resource for dotfiles on GitHub [dotfiles.github.io](dotfiles.github.io)
